## üìò Overview
In the world of cloud-native infrastructure, Identity and Access Management (IAM) is the first line of defense‚Äîand often the most targeted. Yet, too many organizations struggle to detect when IAM credentials are misused or abused. The **IAM Authentication Audit Tracker** simulates a real-world detection and response pipeline for IAM authentication behaviors using AWS-native services.

Built for security engineers, auditors, and GRC practitioners, this lab showcases how AWS CloudTrail, CloudWatch, and Lambda can work together to flag suspicious login patterns, enforce alerting policies, and feed audit trails into compliance reporting workflows. Whether you're preparing for a security assessment or defending a production environment, this tracker brings theory to life.

## üéØ Objectives
- Monitor IAM authentication activities in real-time using AWS CloudTrail and CloudWatch.
- Detect anomalous or suspicious login behaviors (e.g., failed logins, logins from new IPs/regions).
- Trigger alerts through CloudWatch Alarms and AWS SNS.
- Automate audit log analysis using Athena and generate compliance-ready reports.
- Map detection logic and reports to NIST SP 800-53 (AU-6, AC-7) and ISO/IEC 27001 A.12.4.
- Demonstrate actionable cloud security GRC practices aligned with industry frameworks.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

### üîê AWS Account
- An active AWS account with **AdministratorAccess** or equivalent IAM permissions:
  - IAM, CloudTrail, CloudWatch, SNS, Lambda, Athena, and S3

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Setup
- AWS CLI v2 (`aws configure`)
- Terraform
- IAM user with programmatic access
- Optional: VS Code + AWS Toolkit

### üì¶ AWS Services Enabled
- **CloudTrail** with S3 + CloudWatch Logs
- **Athena** + **S3** for queries
- **CloudWatch Alarms**, **SNS**, **Lambda**

### üìù IAM Permissions Required
- `CloudTrailFullAccess`
- `CloudWatchFullAccess`
- `AmazonS3FullAccess`
- `AmazonAthenaFullAccess`
- `AWSLambda_FullAccess`
- `AmazonSNSFullAccess`
- `AWSConfigUserAccess`

## üß™ Lab Steps

1. **Enable CloudTrail** with S3 + CloudWatch Logs delivery.
2. **Create Log Metric Filter** in CloudWatch for failed `ConsoleLogin`.
3. **Set CloudWatch Alarm** to detect 5+ failed logins in 5 minutes.
4. **Create SNS Topic** for security alerts.
5. *(Optional)* Add Lambda for alert enrichment.
6. **Use Athena** to query logs and detect trends.

## üõ†Ô∏è Automation (Terraform)
Terraform IaC is located in the `terraform/` folder and includes:
- S3 bucket for CloudTrail logs
- CloudTrail with CloudWatch Logs integration
- IAM role/policy for CloudTrail logging
- Metric filter and alarm for failed logins
- SNS for alerting

## üìã Compliance Mapping

| Framework | Control       | Mapping Details |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| NIST 800-53 | AU-6, AC-7   | Alerting on login failures, centralized logging |
| ISO 27001   | A.12.4       | Monitoring and audit logs |
| CSA CCM     | IAM-03, SEF-02 | IAM behavior tracking and audit enablement |
| CIS v8      | Controls 5, 8 | Account + audit log management |

## üß† Skills Demonstrated

- AWS CloudTrail + CloudWatch integration
- Terraform IaC for security detection setup
- Audit log querying with Athena
- Compliance mapping (NIST, ISO, CSA)
- Detection of IAM anomalies and alerting

## üìö Resources
- AWS CloudTrail
- AWS CloudWatch
